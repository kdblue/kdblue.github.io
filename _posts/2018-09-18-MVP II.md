In Android MVP II , we are gonna see some example .

Scenario : We retrive Posts from server and show in Android using Retrofit http library.

Posts Link : https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts (its get request , where you get posts)

Requirements : Retrofit ,Recyclerview, converter-gson and little bit mind :)


add this dependency in app level gradle file

    implementation 'com.squareup.retrofit2:retrofit:2.4.0'
    implementation 'com.squareup.retrofit2:converter-gson:2.3.0'
    implementation 'com.android.support:recyclerview-v7:27.1.1'

We start from Contract Interface .(Dont scared because of interface , make habit of use of Interface )

In Contract interface , we will create inner Interface like View, Presenter and Repository.



    public interface Contract {

        /*I created this interface for simplicity , so you can add
         * new feature in future .its helps alot , i will suggest you this pattern*/
    
        //View
        interface View{
            //show loading on screem until response come
            void showProgress();

            // hide loading when response came from presenter
            void hideProgress();

            //used when successful response came from presenter
            void onSuccessResult(List<Posts> postsList);

            //used when unsuccessful response came from presenter
            void onFailedResult(String msg);
        }
    
        //Presenter
        interface Presenter{
    
            //sending request to repository
            void onPostsRequest();
    
            //receiving response from repository when response is successful
            void onSuccess(List<Posts> postsList);
    
            //receiving response from repository when response id unsuccessful
            void onFailed(String msg);
    
        }
    
        //Repository
        interface Repository{
            void repoPosts();
        }

    }
