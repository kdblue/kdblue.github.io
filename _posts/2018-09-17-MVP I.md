1) what is MVP ?

MVP is Architecture . basically used for larger android projects .

b) Easy to understand , maintaining code is easy and easy to modify .

c) it's easy to understand by other developers  


3)we are gonna start with [ 1) View 2) Presenter 3) Model ]

1) View : View Means whatever we see on screen like , loading , animations and Toast etc.(Example User pass user_name and user_email from view to presenter )

2) Presenter : its middle men between Views and Model .(Example presenter pass user_name and user_email to Model(Repository) and waiting for response)

3) Model : its not pojo Model class, in other terms we call Model as Repository , we goona use Model name as Repository name . its easy understand for you .(Example Repository pass user_name and user_email to server and perform operations and return response to Presenter and Presenter pass to View )

a) what we do in repository ?
 In Repository we do task like network operations , DB or Sqlite Operations , or SharedPreference Operations etc .
